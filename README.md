# Azure_Data_Factory_Learning
This is the repository where I'm documenting what I'm learning in Azure Data Factory.

So far, I have learned how Azure works, how to create containers and Data Factory, and how Data Factory operates with some working examples. I combined what I learned into a project and published it on GitHub.
